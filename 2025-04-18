Day In review...
On today we jumped deeper into subnetting and it definetly helped with my understanding.
I know if focus on more practice questions I will have an easier time understanding as well as implementing Mr.Daryls chart. 
A subnet increases the number of devices that can be added to a LAN.
It reduces traffic congestion and processing load on computers and routers, while isolating sensitive systems on the NET and effieciently allocating available IP's.
The difference between classful and classless-as one uses default subnet mask while the other completely ignores the default and borrows bits from hosts.
As far as Address Resolution Procotol (ARP) it's known to map the IP address to the MAC address. It finds another computers MAC address based on IP.
When it comes to the casting process of IP addresses, they vary from IPv4 to IPv6, as IPv4 provides unicast, multicast and broadcast.
Unicasting is from one station to another , multicast is from one to everyone at once, while broadcast is from one to many "interested" devices.
IPv6 provides Unicast, multicast, and anycast-and anycast is one to the nearest; which is determined by hops, distance, efficiency, and latency.
Class ended a bit early today, but we did start on a few more of the labs in comptia+ as well.
