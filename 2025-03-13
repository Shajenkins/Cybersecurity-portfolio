We kicked off with a review of virtualization, breaking down the differences between Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors. 
Then, we finally got our hands dirty with the basics of Ubuntu, which was honestly pretty cool.
But what really shook up the class? The CLI (Command Line Interface). 
While some  already knew their way around, a lot of us needed a deeper understanding. 
It’s definitely gonna be one of the tougher topics, but I’m ready for the challenge.
