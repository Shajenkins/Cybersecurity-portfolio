Day in review
Today we took a deeper dive into linux while focuseing on file system navigation, the different types, directory structure, chain commands and more.
We also learned about soft and hard links, redirection and ways to find specific pathways etc. 
Its getting a bit more intense, but i'm remaining open to the challenges ahead.
