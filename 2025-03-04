Day in review: 
The first day in Cybersecurity 25-8 was absolutely amazing. 
From the beginning, introductions of the team to the tour that was led by Mr. McQueen, and thereafter receiving our laptops and getting a glimpse into what things would be like.
It has truly been a very passionate and exciting start to the course. 
I personally can appreciate all aspects of the City of Refuge. 
Although I may not require all the resources, it is a very beautiful thing to see the opportunities provided for the community. 
I cannot express enough how honored I am to have been selected and I am looking forward to the trials and tribulations of this learning experience.
