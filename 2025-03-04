Day in Review
The second day began with Mr. Adam Bricker, and let me just say—I had no idea what we were in for.
He opened with what has quickly become one of my favorite quotes: “Earn the right to serve.” In other words, you can’t just walk into a position expecting to be given authority without putting in the work. True credibility comes not only from experience but also from a deep sense of self-assurance—so much so that you can confidently serve others or offer critique from a place of knowledge and integrity.
And that was just the tip of the iceberg.
Mr. Bricker went on to highlight essential life skills that extend far beyond this course-like curiosity, collaboration, critical thinking, grit, maintaining agency under duress, and humility.
As the lesson unfolded, he introduced key concepts: the importance of sleep, the necessity of taking breaks, how to learn effectively, the power of habits, and how courage in one area of life builds courage in all areas.
Toward the end of class, he challenged us with a soul sturring, though provoking assignment;not on what we want to do, but on who we want to become. To solidify this idea, he prompted us to write a future Wall Street Journal article about ourselves, envisioning the person we aspire to be and using the skills we’ll develop throughout the week to bring that vision to life.
Though this exercise is an ongoing process, writing my article has already been an eye-opening experience. Seeing my aspirations laid out in hyper-specific detail has not only deepened my self-awareness but also given me a clearer path to becoming the person I truly want to be.
