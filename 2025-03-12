Day In review 
Today we had Mr.Ron Cofield and Paul Farley speak with us.
They emphasized on things such as core values, emphasizing seminol life events, being proactive and knowing when to take the punch. 
One thing that Mr. Paul said was " I didnt like it , but I learned to appreciate it." 
I'm at that point in my life where I dont agree with everything I hear but I want to learn to appreciate the different perspectives. 
Ms. Angie and Isabelle also came to speak with the ladies about proper business casual attire.
