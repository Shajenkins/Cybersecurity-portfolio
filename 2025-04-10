Day in review-Spring break edition 
Another day on break and I found myself starting the Jason Dion practice quiz ...
I must say it was way more difficult than I intended, but I  have found myself being able to take notes from the questions to study on for later.
Although there were a lot of questions I didnt uderstand, there were some things that critical thinking , context clues and some previous information helped me to answer them.
I didn't make the best score , but for my first attempt-with the lack of knowledge...
I am simply excited to see what I can do once I learn the rest of the information required for me to pass this course, obtain certs, as well as continue to be successful in this field.
