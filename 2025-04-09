Day In review-Spring break edition..
Another day of break and I found myself reviewing some of the content in class and notes that I'd taken , while also rewatching some of the videos I pulled up from class.
The "Sunny Classroom" video touched on wiring, from the Ethernet, UTP VS STP and the other various networking cables
Although I didnt have musch time , I did findn myself having familiarity of the content , in which I'm becoming a bit more confident in the knowledge we are reviewing.
