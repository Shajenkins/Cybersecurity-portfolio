Day In review
On this day, we officially began class and started working with Mr. Darryl.
He kicked things off by breaking down the seven essential parts of a computer and diving into what makes up a motherboard.
But we didn’t stop at the hardware as we also focused on software and storage, exploring how they’ve evolved over time.
This is a big switch from professional development, yet the essential factors of life still apply.
After everything I learned today, I find myself questioning every electronic I see—wondering what it is and how the computer inside is operating. 
With that being said, I look forward to the lessons to come.
