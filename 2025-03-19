Day in review 
Today we had professional development with mr Ron Cofield and alumni Don Howard. 
Mr. Ron had the class take a personality (ennegram) test in which it revealed an inkling of the kind of people we are.
It was very intersting to learn the types in the class and how they could all play a crucial role in a business enviroment. 
I turned out to be an 8 (The challenger) Wing 7 (The enthusiast) in which I do see how I embody both of these on a daily basis. 
Don Howard was very relatable in his paath to success and realistic in the fact that the journey in tech will not be easy. 
Lastly, Primous and JW both came in and taught us some professinal, ocial and dining ettiqute which would help us gain more confidence and networking events. 
I enjoyed class today as it was full of many different aspects of what we would are dealing with now and what we would encounter in our future endeavours.
