Day in Review
Mr. Bricker started the day by asking us what lesson from yesterday we most wanted to put into action. For me, it was the concept of mental models—understanding how I learn best and creating traction in my mind based on my unique way of processing information. 
Beyond that, I also want to be more mindful of the question: “What information might prove me wrong?” Too often, I catch myself operating from ego, which blinds me to the bigger picture. It keeps me from approaching situations with grace—entering and exiting with humility and openness. That’s a habit I’m determined to shift.
Mr. Bricker also reinforced a powerful idea: “We is better than me.” This reminder pushed me to think deeper about how I can better serve both myself and those around me. By embracing collaboration and a broader perspective, I know I can grow into a more effective and thoughtful version of myself.
On the cybersecurity front, Mr. Bricker introduced us to five basic yet crucial measures for protecting our privacy and security. He distinguished privacy (knowing who you are) from security (knowing what you did or said). The five key practices include: End-to-end email encryption, A virtual private network (VPN), A password manager, Multi-factor authentication, and A security agent to detect vulnerabilities
To build on yesterday’s lesson about habits and skills, we watched a summary of "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. Mr. Bricker emphasized the importance of playing to your strengths, blocking your weaknesses, and positioning yourself for greatness.
Oh, and let me not forget the infamous Mr. Bruce. There was something almost otherworldly about him—meticulous, miraculous, and truly a phenomenon. Watching him in real time as he told his story of founding C.O.R and M.O.S.T was captivating. 
I had the honor of asking him about the greatest lesson he learned from starting City of Refuge, and his answer was profound: “That there is something good in everyone.”
I was once told that rich people only care about money and themselves. Maybe that’s true for those only rich in finances. But Mr. Bruce? He’s rich in spirit, wisdom, faith, knowledge, and love. A man of that stature shatters that stereotype a thousand times over.
Along with the staff he employes, whom are truly in fine alignment. 
Mr. Bricker also emphasized the importance of finding a mentor. He was clear about the right way to align yourself with one: be clear, concise, and easily accessible.
To wrap up the class, he broke down some of the most effective forms of learning;what he called the superpower of the 21st century. These include: Constructive debate, Self-testing, Gaming, and even Storytelling.
Between cybersecurity, habits, mentorship, and learning strategies, today was packed with invaluable lessons. Each one is another step toward becoming the person I truly want to be.
