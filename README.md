# Cybersecurity-portfolio
A portfolio showcasing my progress and achievements in cybersecurity. 
Hi, my name is Sha-Mia Jenkins.
My hometown is Atlanta, GA, USA.
My previous IT expereince involves a mix of troubleshooting, guiding others through digital tools and managing accounts-- skills I unknowingly honed that aligned closely with cybersecurity. These experiences along with a strong pull by God is what sparked an interest in the field. 
In the future, I'm focused on deepening my expertise in digital forensics and security analysis ,while staying open to roles like security architect. I aim to protect the digital community, especially by providing more effiecient ways to secure music files, data and intellectual properties for the artist community. 
An experience that I am most proud of has to be my jouney with music. I am a self taught lyricist as well as engineer, in which I am in the works of expanding my knowledge to producing as well. I have multiple beautifully curated singles out along with one EP and am looking to release my 100+ projects as albums, EPs, or singles. This experience stands out to me , because it has been another God given gift and venture that has been undeniable throughout my life.
