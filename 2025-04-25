Day In Review...
Today we went over collision domains, broadcast domains and and VLANs.
When dealing with collision and broadcast domains, hubs are known to expand collision domains-being that they are unintelligent. 
While routers are known to seperate broadcast donmains and switches are known to expand broadcast domains.
A VLAN is a virtual local area network, it is known for spliting one physical network into multiple mini networks. 
Being that they seperate network traffic , one VLAN cannot communicate with another without a router involved.
We learned that if a router doesn't get response it will ask default gateway.
A way to connect multiple broadcast domains is by using VLANs.
Multiple VLANS within a switch are connected by a layer 3 device.
It seperate traffic logically and prevents heavy congestion byh seperating broadcast domains. 
Reasons for VLANs are segmentation, simple network design/deployment, along with easy troubleshooting and management.
While reviewing subnets and VLANs we realized they were alot alike, we found that the biggest difference is one is physical while another is virtual.
VLAN enabled switch ports can be configured to seperate network traffic, which makes it smoother and easier to use. 
Subnetting implements IP segmentation and IP addressing, routing.
While a VLAN implements logical segmentation via tagging traffic with VLAN ID.
A static VLAN is defined by thr jack, involves 1 port to 1 VLAN.
While a dynamic VLAN is defined by MAC addressing and involves 1 port to multiple VLANs.
InterVLAN checks the network between different VLANs.
A router on a stick consists of router and a switch , an ethernet (one link) configured as 802.1q trunk.
Multilayer switch involves interVLAN routing.
A trunk is a logical configuration, IP converter, a link from switch to router.
