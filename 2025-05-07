Day in Review
Today’s professional development was led by Ron Cofield, and babyyy, he brought the wisdom.

He opened with a powerful concept about storytelling — how we often highlight the “Hero”, but overlook the importance of the “Guide”. The guide isn’t the main character, but they play a crucial role in the hero’s journey. They’re the stepping stone, the whisper of direction, the mirror that pushes the hero to rise. Real quiet power.

Ron also introduced “The Trusted Advisor” by James Maister, breaking down the Trust Formula:
C + R + I / S
Where:

C = Credibility
R = Reliability
I = Intimacy
S = Self-orientation (ego, self-interest)

Here’s what stood out:

Credibility is built by:
Observing before speaking
Understanding systems & culture
Advising with facts, not fluff
Shadowing, gaining software skills, and being that go-to resource
Professional Intimacy shows up in:
Truly listening to understand, not just to respond
Being personable and showing real interest
Uplifting and encouraging others

Reliability means:
Keeping your word
Being punctual and present
Doing what you said you would do — consistently

Self is all about balance:
Managing ego and confidence
Being honest about your own limits
Knowing when to step back, so you don’t burn out trying to be everything to everyone

The rest of the day? Whew, that belonged to the one and only Hadji Hicks.
His story was raw, real, and revelational. He laid out his journey before, during, and after his time at COR. And one thing he drove home was:

“Don’t be afraid to start over.”

That hit deep. He’s a living example of resilience — a warrior, a walking miracle, and even though I didn’t witness his transformation firsthand, I’m extremely proud of him. It was an honor to hear him speak.

Sometimes you’re the Hero, sometimes you’re the Guide. But both matter. And no matter what chapter you’re in, you can always rewrite your story.
