Day in Review: Federal Reserve Bank Field Trip – BTS 2025 Conference

Today was nothing short of unforgettable. As part of our professional development, my cohort had the honor of visiting the Federal Reserve Bank. 
Naturally, being a federal building, security was intense. 
Upon arrival, we were met by gates, armed guards, and a K-9 unit ready to inspect IDs & vehicles.

After stepping out of the vehicle, we handed over our IDs to be verified. 
Once the dog completed its sweep and we were cleared, we proceeded inside. 
The moment we entered, we were warmly greeted by Ms. Krista Kohlhausen deKryger & her superior, amidst metal detectors, more security, & a courteous staff presence. 
The interior was a blend of beautiful artwork & a surprisingly simple layout — refined, but not overwhelming.

Once everyone arrived, we made our way to the Azalea Room, where the BTS 2025 CON – Business, Technology, & Security Conference – was being held. 
Walking into the room, we were met with the dynamic duo: Ms. Ria Aiken & Ms. Jean Harvey Johnson.

Ms. Ria set the tone beautifully, inviting us to reflect on how we integrate AI into our lives — personally & professionally. 
As moderator, her cadence, clarity, & ability to articulate brought a grounded energy to the room. 
She did a remarkable job capturing & expanding on the insights shared by Ms. Jean Harvey Johnson.

And listen… Ms. Jean? Whew. What a woman.

From investment banking to operations in tech, her journey is nothing short of extraordinary. 
She spoke with passion and purpose, emphasizing how she has helped transform work environments — not just for clients & end-users, but for internal teams as well. 
Her focus on being personable in professional spaces stood out. 
She reminded us that it’s not enough to just introduce AI tools — we must also teach people how to use them effectively & confidently.

One of the most impactful takeaways she left us with: maintain your work-life balance. She didn’t just say it — she broke it down:

Set boundaries.

Take time to rest and disengage.

Use your vacation days.

Build a support team.

Get a coach.

& carve out time to reenergize.

As one of the most women-led cohorts in our program’s history, this experience hit deep. 
There’s often a noticeable shortage of women — especially Black and Brown women — in tech, business, & security spaces. 
So to walk into a room full of powerful women like Ms.Ria, Ms.Jean, Ms. Pamela Cooper & Ms. Tairreon Harten, both Federal Reserve Bank employees, was healing and affirming.

After the conference, we got to meet Mr. Joshua from Microsoft. 
His energy was unmatched — light-hearted yet deeply inspiring. 
He walked us through the GCC version of Microsoft Copilot for 365, giving us a glimpse of AI in action from an enterprise-level perspective. 
As someone who’s carving a path in a space like this, it made me even more excited for the tools I’ll get to use one day soon.

To top it off, we explored their “Bake Off” competition — yes, cake and tech in one room! (The lemon cake had me in a chokehold). 
Alongside that, we witnessed some dope tech innovations:

A laser projection Bluetooth keyboard

VR glasses (not a headset!)

A triple laptop screen extender

& my favorite: an accessibility tool that lines up with your hand so you can tap surfaces to type — no keyboard needed!

We ended the day with lunch, photo ops, and one last conversation with Ms. Jean. A full-circle moment.

This wasn’t just a field trip — it was a glimpse into the future, a reminder of the power we hold, and a beautiful example of what happens when women are centered and supported in tech spaces.

Truly, a day to remember.
