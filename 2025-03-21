Day in review..
Today we reviewed why or why wouldn't we implement a source code. 
We also discussed "tar" and "gzip" differ in action as tar is packing the files while gzip is actually compressing. 
From there we continued on to process management and the main processors being intel and amd . 
Following up was the emphasis on the difference between a process and a thread.As threads are the working subprogram that works together to run the process. Like the chefs in a kitche.
Last but not least we discussed user process vs system processes and the fact that parent processes can have a child and a child can have a child. Along with identifiying the state of a process.
Also aia left out of my last created file that I attended my first CISO roundtable & I must say it was an experience to remember.
I'm excited to succeed and be a graduate speaking on my current and future eneavors, motivating the next class and encouraging the vendors to reach out to cohort 9.
