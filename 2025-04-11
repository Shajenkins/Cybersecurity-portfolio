Day In review-spring break editon...

Don't get me wrong-yess I must admit it was needed to reset, but the depth and tricky wording of this content and it's scenarios makes me feel we need all the time we can get.
After reviewing my questions on the practice test and seeing how easily I was tripped up-by a simple mistake of not paying attention to key words, or simply not knowing the content-
In order to know thats what I needed to pay attention to specifically..
It truly makes me lock in with myself and having a keen understanding of what is being placed in front of me or asked of me
I firmly believe with some hands on work, inclusive class discussions , problem solving , even vocabulary quizzes it will help this information stick more efficiently.
