Day In review-spring break editon...
Today is the final day of break before hopping back into the course class environment
And with that I have taken the time to complete quiz 2 , in which I made an 84%.
I did not feel this was as difficult as quiz 1 and I felt confident in many of my answers.
Although it did not show exactly what I gpt wrong, I got 5 wrong and 27 right so that definetly boosted my confidence some more
I am also finding myself reviewing the notes ive taken over the quizzes and taking a peak at lesson 3 before hopping back in tommorow.
Though this break seemed mighty short, I think it still helped me refresh and try to gain an understanding of knowledge in a way thats digestable to me .
Mr. Daryl said before the break, take this time , review the content and see if this is something you still wish to pursue and so I must say--
I appreicate the time off, but it's back into what I came for..
