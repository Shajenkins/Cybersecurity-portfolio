Day In Review...
Today was the last day with Mr. Adam, and though it was, we spent more time in team collaboration. 
The day before, he mentioned that we would be playing a game. I was one of the few who actually knew what the game was beforehand, so I did my research. 
However, even with my preparation, I had no idea just how exhilarating and stimulating this game would be.
After Mr. Adam explained the instructions to the class, I briefed my fellow team leads, and we broke off into groups as the anticipation set in. 
While some were initially confused, others jumped right in. As we played, the seven essential life skills...curiosity, critical thinking, collaboration, discipline, grit, and urgency under duress—began to unfold right before our eyes.
Through this task, I learned more about my classmates, and by the second round, I had discovered even more about myself.
Mr. Adam is a phenomenal human being, and I truly appreciate the time he took out of his schedule to be with us this past week.
It was a great way to ease us into the program, and I’m looking forward to what’s in store for the rest of this course.
