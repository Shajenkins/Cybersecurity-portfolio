Day in review 
Whew, This day started off with virtualization and understanding between type 1 and type 2.
The biggest difference is one is a direct connection while two requires an OS software to run.
Virtualization is basically a bunch of minicomputers operating virtually in one physical computer. 
THEN I was overtaken by what are known as binary codes. I have heard of them before but never fully tried to calculate them myself and if i'm being honest during class I was getting a bit overwhelmed because I could not figure out how they were solving them.
Then Mr.Daryyl showed us the way , in which truthfully I was still a bit confused at first. So when I went to work I found myself working them out on my own and eventually wound up get almost every one I did right. 
Where I was messing up at was the idea that the decimal had to fit into the power of 2 when in reality the power has to fit into the decimal. 
Now that I found my mistake and have developed a better understanding, I feel a lot better about it.
