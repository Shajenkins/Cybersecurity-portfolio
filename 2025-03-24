Day in review...
Yesterday was actually very enlightening for me. Many who have taken networking, including Mr. Daryl, have mentioned that it would be difficult. 
While I’m not saying it won’t be challenging, I’ve actually enjoyed diving into networking fundamentals so far.
From translating binary to dotted decimal and vice versa to exploring hexadecimals, everything has been intriguing. 
Understanding the seven layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and how they work together reminds me of a Russian nesting doll—each layer fitting within another, playing its role in the bigger picture.
Learning about networking protocols, port numbers, and the concept of bandwidth has been especially fascinating. 
As an artist, I find it interesting how bandwidth can be loosely related to music—both dealing with frequency, transmission, and flow.
Though networking is said to be complex, I’m looking forward to learning more and embracing the challenge ahead!
