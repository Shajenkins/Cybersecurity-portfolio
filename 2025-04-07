Day in Review... Spring Break Edition
Although we’re currently on spring break, I’ve made it a point to stay committed to my studies and continue progressing. 
Today, I took the time to revisit Lesson 1 on Networking. I went over the material carefully, taking extra notes to reinforce the concepts. 
I find that detailed repetition really helps me retain the information more effectively.
After reviewing the lesson, I completed the Lesson 1 quiz, which consisted of 45 questions. 
I’ll be honest—this was the most challenging quiz we’ve had so far. It took me a while to get through it, but I made the effort to take notes on most of the questions. 
Breaking each one down and really trying to understand what was being asked helped me stay focused and improved my comprehension.
I also leaned heavily on the process of elimination. Going through each answer choice and analyzing whether it truly applied to the question helped me rule out incorrect options and sharpen my critical thinking.
Overall, it was a productive day, and I feel more confident about my understanding of the material because I didn’t rush through it—I took the time to really learn.
