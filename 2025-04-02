Day in review...
Today was professional development, Today was all about self-awareness, strategy, and career growth. 
We began with Ron Cofield’s projection of how our career would play out- a workshop, using enneagram scores to help us map out cybersecurity career paths that align with our strengths. 
Because truthfully —knowing yourself is just as important as knowing your tech.
We had a suprise visit by Christian Derricks, an IT Lead at EY, whom drfopped gems about his journey and the lessons that shaped his career.
Craig BaLtes did an improvised discussion being sure to wrap his discussion in a relatable perspective, while also breaking down how AI is transforming cybersecurity and what that means for future roles.
Primous closed out the day with an interactive session on workplace dynamics and corporate culture. 
We tackled real-world challenges, shared insights, and built strategies for thriving in professional spaces.
The key takeaways from the day include:
Knowing Yourself – We explored Enneagram personality types and how they shape decision-making, leadership, and problem-solving.
Being intentional about your  career planning – Self-awareness isn’t just personal growth; it’s a career tool. The more you understand your strengths and work style, the better you can position yourself.
And last, but not least the workplace Culture & roles that best fit you – Success in tech isn’t just about skills—it’s about knowing how to collaborate, adapt, and lead.
At the end of the day, cybersecurity is more than just tech. It’s about strategy, adaptability, and playing to your strengths.
