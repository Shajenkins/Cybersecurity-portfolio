Day In Review 
In class we covered the different ways to learn and that one of the most efficient ways is to test immediately after exposure. 
The discipline of touch is also another great way of not only learning, but retaining the information. 
The main gut of class was ways to remain indistractable and for me , something I need to work on is mastering internal triggers.
Also another thing that rrally stuck with me was HALT, dont make a decision when you're Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Or Tired because I have made terrible decisions in those states. 
We also watched a video on the power of discipline by daniel walter  and the 70% rule stuck out to me because i've felt that and still decided to be indecisive which has hindered me in more ways than one.
Lastly, for homework we were supposed to write down 5-7 things that make a team best in collaboration to achieve a Tech goal and I chose:
Autonomous role play, clear communication,trust, solid understanding of goal, open feedback, oopen to change , being decisive, and being able to identify not only the known,but the unknown as well.
