### Key Takeaways:
- Imagine if you had a **bank account** that deposited 1 cent per second... would you cherish it more?
- Would you **sell a year** of your life to a millionaire like Oprah? Some folks bid, but **mine is PRICELESS.**
- Time is our greatest currency. Use it **intentionally.**

### How to Use Time Better:
- Build efficient **habits** and **discipline**
- **Prioritize** key tasks
- **Remove distractions**
- Focus on **impact**, not just activity

He closed by asking us to **reflect on how we plan our days**. A powerful moment, no lie.
