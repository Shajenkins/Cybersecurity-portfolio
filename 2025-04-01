Day in Review
Today’s class ran smoothly as we delved deeper into networking concepts. We explored different types of networks, comparing client-server and peer-to-peer models in terms of centralization, cost, setup complexity, and maintenance.
Next, we examined LAN topology, focusing on how network devices are connected and how signals flow. We discussed physical, logical, and hybrid topologies, along with their variations, including bus, point-to-point, ring, star, and mesh structures.
From there, we revisited the OSI model and its role in networking, particularly in data encapsulation and de-encapsulation. We also took a closer look at SOHO routers, understanding their components and where they are most commonly used.
One of the most engaging parts of the class for me was troubleshooting methodology. It was interesting to see how the structured approach to diagnosing network issues mirrors the way I naturally troubleshoot problems outside of technology.
Lastly, we touched on the Internet of Things (IoT)—a term I hadn’t realized applied to so many everyday devices. Learning how these interconnected devices communicate was eye-opening.
Overall, today’s lesson deepened my understanding of networking and its real-world applications.
After class, we visited Clark Atlanta University to attend a cybersecurity panel focused on AI, essential skills for cybersecurity professionals, and key career tips for students like us.
One of the biggest takeaways was the importance of:
Understanding yourself—knowing your strengths and what problems you want to solve.
Being a go-getter—taking initiative in your learning and career.
Being intentional—applying for positions that align with your skills and crafting a strong value proposition.
To wrap up the day, we returned to CoR and checked in on the upcoming AI workshops we’ll be volunteering for this Friday. These sessions will cover everything from AI ethics to using generative AI to enhance our portfolios, résumés, and interview skills.
I’m excited to explore new ways to leverage Gen AI for my professional growth and add it to my skill set.
