Today, we took a deeper dive into IPv6 versus IPv4. One key difference is that IPv6 incorporates the MAC address, while IPv4 uses a dotted decimal format. 
We also explored other distinctions, like how IPv6 relies on hexadecimal, whereas IPv4 is based on binary.
Another topic that threw me off for a moment was reserved private IP addresses. 
At first, I assumed that private IPs were categorized differently from public ones within the class system, but I realized that private addresses exist within Class A, B, and C—it just depends on the range.
We also covered NAT (Network Address Translation), which allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP. Without NAT, IPv4 addresses would've been exhausted long ago!
Digging deeper into DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), I learned how it automatically assigns IP addresses, unlike static configurations where you manually set them.
One thing that stood out to me was how DHCP, DNS, and the Default Gateway often share the same IP address—usually because the router handles all three functions.
Finally, we broke down the Domain Name Space structure: it starts at the root, followed by the Top-Level Domain (TLD), then the Second-Level Domain (SLD), and finally the host computer.
I really am enjoying learning networking so far.
