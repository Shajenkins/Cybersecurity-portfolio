Day in review...
Today we reviewed nslookup , dig, resolvectl, default gateway, ping , traceroute, ARP, tcpdump, and wireshark. 
Nslookup, dig and resolve gather and test name resolution info in their own depth.
The default gateway is a network device (router) that connects different networks and allow data to flow between the same network. 
A ping is something that verifies the connectivity in a network.
A traceroute is similar to ping, but it notates the hops from each router path between source and destination. 
Tcpdump collects packets and frames and segment that determine the traffic type and content. 
While wireshark is the same as tcp it differs in the fact that its GUI vs tcp is CLI. 
YAML is a human readable data serialization , that ain't markup langauge . Also defined by JSON. 
 We also reviewed a daemon, which is aka a process and service. 
 last but not least we reviewed systemctl command and the importance in controlling systemd units. Using subcommands such as start,stop,restart,enable and last, but not least reload.
