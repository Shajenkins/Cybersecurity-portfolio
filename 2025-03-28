Day In Review..,
On this day we touched on firewalls and how they act as a protective barrier between private network and the internet by filtering and routing.
We also jumped into the ACL , Which is known as the access control list , which are rules to process packets that allow or denies certain IP addresses, port numbers and protocols.
Continuing on-- we learned the difference between a host and network based firewall.
W hile host is strictly software that protects the computer only; network based is hardware and software that protects the entire network.
In this lesson we also learned that a firewall contains two major actions; packet routing and the access control list. 
Linux firewalls are based upon a netfilter used for network address and port translation. 
Building upon that is the iptable that contains statements that tell the system what to do with a packet, whether its blocking or forwarding. 
As far as uncomplicated firewalls, they are exactly as they sound-- a firewall that is GUI based and user friendly. 
To continue, we learned that in a firewall you have zone. These are preconstructed rules for trust levels that are applied to different network interfaces.
Last, but not least we learned the importance of SSH authentication, which requires both a private and public key pair. 
Whereas the public key can be given away, but the private key is to NEVER be shared. The private key signs and encrypts; while the public key, verifies and decrpyts. 
The test to pass linux and become fully admitted into the course is on Monday, and I am feeling confident and encouraged.
