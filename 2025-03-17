Day In review 
Today, we delved deeper into the specifics of grep, followed by a discussion on user management. 
This led us to explore IAM (Identity and Access Management), which consists of Identity, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.
In Linux, we learned the distinction between users and groups, as well as the concept of primary and secondary groups. 
Additionally, we covered how the shadow file separates passwords from usernames, while the passwd file contains other non-confidential user information.
We also explored the function of SUDO, including how it can be used to add a user. Finally, we wrapped up with an introduction to the basics of encryption algorithms.
