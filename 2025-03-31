Day in Review
Wow, today was exhilarating! We took the Linux Foundations test—a key evaluation of our ability to continue in the program. 
I say this with both humility and confidence: I feel really good about my performance.
I approached the test strategically, answering the questions I felt most confident about first, then circling back to tackle the more challenging ones. 
There were two fill in the blank questions that really made me pause. I took a moment, prayed, moved on to other questions, and then by God’s grace the answers came to me.
While I feel strong about my performance, I know this test isn’t the only determining factor for advancing in the program. 
Beyond my technical knowledge, my passion for leadership, professionalism, community, and discipline will continue to drive my success.
As I await my results, I remain confident and encouraged, trusting the process and staying committed to my growth.
Either way I am extremely grateful for this opportunity and experience to grow.
