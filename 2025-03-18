Day in review 
On this day we focused on permissions and the difference between permissons and rights. 
Also how ownership is assigned defining who has control. 
We tied in how whoami from the earlier lessons is what is used to identify the current user or group.
Later in the class we went over absolute and octal modes , which felt a lot like binary all over again. 
Furthermore we did some excercises to see how much we understood the permissions.
Last but not least , we covered chmod and chown and the different changes that can be made with each.
Before class ended a few people from TAG came in to take a peak at what we were learning and introduce themselves as well as pick our brains a little. 
It was a very productive day !
