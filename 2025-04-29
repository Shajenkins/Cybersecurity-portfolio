Day In Review... Trying a new format
DNS & Directory Services 

On today's session, we reviewed and expanded our knowledge of **DNS (Domain Name System)**. Below is a breakdown of key concepts, processes, and terms discussed.

---

##  What is DNS?
DNS translates **domain names** (ie Google.com) into **IP addresses** (like `8.8.8.8`) and vice versa. It's basically the phonebook of the internet.

---

##  DNS Lookup Process
1. **Client (OS)** checks local DNS cache.
2. If not found, checks the **`hosts` file**.
3. If still unresolved, sends query to the **DNS resolver (usually ISP)**.
4. Resolver checks its **cache**.
5. If no match:
   - Asks the **Root Server** (may respond with uncertainty).
   - Gets referred to the **TLD Server** (`.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc.).
   - Then referred to the **Authoritative Name Server**, which holds the actual IP info.
6. Resolver stores the result in **cache** and returns it to the client.

---

## Recursive vs Iterative DNS Queries
- **Recursive Lookup**: DNS resolver is responsible for tracking down the full answer.
- **Iterative Lookup**: Resolver asks each server in turn until the answer is found.

---

## FQDN - Fully Qualified Domain Name
- An FQDN includes the full domain path, e.g., `www.example.com.`

---

## DNS Zones & Zone Types
- A **DNS zone** is a portion of the DNS namespace managed by a DNS server.

### Zone Types:
1. **Primary Zone**: Editable, hosted on primary servers. Replicates for redundancy/load balancing.
2. **Secondary Zone**: Read-only copy pulled from a primary server.
3. **Cache-Only Zone**: Temporarily stores results using TTL (Time to Live).

## DNS Records (Zone File Entries)
| Record | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `A`    | Maps domain name to IPv4 address |
| `AAAA` | Maps domain name to IPv6 address |
| `CNAME`| Alias of one domain to another |
| `MX`   | Mail exchange; must point to an `A` record |
| `SOA`  | Start of Authority; holds admin info for the zone |
| `NS`   | Name Server; defines authoritative DNS servers |
| `SRV`  | Service record; includes port number for services |
| `PTR`  | Pointer record; maps IP address to domain (reverse lookup) |
| `TXT`  | Contains arbitrary text data; often used for SPF/DKIM (email) |

---

## Resolver Behavior
- A resolver can be configured by an admin to contact specific DNS servers.
- Works recursively or iteratively.
- Stores answers in **cache** for performance.

---

## Forwarding
- **Standard Forwarding**: If resolver can't resolve, it forwards the request to another DNS server.
- **Conditional Forwarding**: Forwards requests **only** for specific domains.

---

## Active Directory (AD) & DNS
- **Active Directory** controls users, computers, and permissions.
- **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**: Defines *who you are*, *what you can access*, and *where your files live*.
- The **Domain Controller (DC)** holds AD data and authenticates users.
- **Internal DNS zones** should be private and blocked from the internet.
- **External DNS zones** should be accessible from the internet.

---

## Key Terms
- **TTL (Time To Live)**: How long DNS records are stored in cache.
- **Zone Transfer**: Syncing DNS data from a primary to a secondary server.
- **Root Server**: The top of the DNS hierarchy.
- **TLD Server**: Manages domain extensions like `.com`, `.net`.

---

## Bonus Analogy
- **Primary Zone** = The *player* (can be edited and replicated).
- **Secondary Zone** = The *environment* (read-only, cloned from the player).
- **Cache Zone** = The *ghost memory* (temporary but useful).

---

## Summary
- DNS is critical for resolving domain names to IP addresses.
- It uses a hierarchy of queries (recursive & iterative).
- Zone types and record types define how data is stored and shared.
- Forwarding helps distribute load and enhance resolution speed.
- Active Directory tightly integrates with DNS for user management and authentication.
