Day in review...
Today was professional development day and full of a lot of helpful tips and insight for our present and future selves.
We started off with a powerpoint presentation presented by Isabelle and Ms.Sybil on the importants of a clean and concise resume and linked in.
One of the major things that stuck with me is knowing your job description. A lot of times I do find myself just blind applying in hopes to secure a job, 
in which Ms. Sybil emphasized is not very intentional.
Though that is true, I have found it being effective in the fact that I always secure a position that way and gain a set of new skills in the process.
But I would like to find more intention and direction in positions that I am applying for and securing. 
Around 10am Mr.Darrell Stinson, CEH, CISSO, CISSP came in with his words of wisdom, career path insight and habits that made hime successful.
From knowing your resume, to finding your stretch(something that forces you into another level). 
He also emphasized the insight that certs represents profieciency, while degrees represent what can be applied.
It's important to have goals that lead to objectives that are followed up by essential tasks.
His successful habits range from physical fitness to reading educational information, having business context, finding way to recharge, and applying your values in an effective manner.
One very valuable piece of information he left us with, was whenever you feel inadequate for a position-ask yourself "How would you see this opportunity as a learning curve(that strecth)??"
After his presentation, we headed out to take headshots by Shane Michael Productions.
And ended the day by completing more of our labs.
