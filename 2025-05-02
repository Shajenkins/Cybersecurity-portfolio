Day In Review... Disaster Recovery & High Availability Systems
Today’s session focused on Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP)—the strategies and actions taken to prevent, respond to, & recover from IT incidents while maintaining critical business functions.

Organizational Priorities:
We kicked things off with a reminder of the three core functions every business relies on:

Operations
Marketing
Finance

  Key Terms & Concepts:
 
  Business Continuity:
Business Continuity Plan (BCP): Strategy to minimize site-wide interruptions and maintain operations.
Business Impact Analysis (BIA): Process of identifying mission-critical assets, processes, and operations.

  Availability Tiers:
High Availability: Always-on systems, minimal downtime, more fault-tolerant.
Standard Availability: Lower fault tolerance, more prone to downtime.
Five 9’s (99.999%) Uptime: Equates to ~5 minutes 15 seconds of annual downtime. etc.

 Infrastructure Resilience:
Clustering: Logical group of servers acting as one.
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks): Provides redundancy and performance.
Load Balancing: Distributes workload across active/passive servers (think: theater understudy—if one fails, the other takes over).
LBFO (Load Balancing Fail Over): Uses NIC teaming for redundant network paths and aggregate bandwidth.

   Recovery Objectives:
RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Max acceptable downtime after a disaster.
RPO (Recovery Point Objective): Max acceptable amount of data loss.

Ask yourself:

"How much data can I afford to lose?"

"How long can I afford to be down?"

 Metrics & Monitoring:
MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure): Average time system operates before failing.
MTTF (Mean Time To Failure): Expected lifespan of non-repairable systems.
MTTR (Mean Time To Repair): Time needed to repair a fault or failure.

 Recovery Sites:
Type	Characteristics
Hot Site	Instant failover (seconds/minutes)
Warm Site	Partial setup with some staff/data (hours)
Cold Site	No equipment/data (days)
Cloud Site	Hosted recovery with shared risk

Power Management:

Spike: Sudden voltage increase (milliseconds)
Surge: Sustained voltage increase (seconds)
Power Sag: Minor voltage drop
Brownout: Prolonged under-voltage
Blackout: Complete power loss

PDU (Power Distribution Unit): Filters and stabilizes grid power
Generator: Backup for grid, used with UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)

Network & Multipathing:
Multipathing: Host-to-host connection via multiple physical links (full/partial mesh)
LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol): Combines multiple links into one logical channel
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP): Prevents loops by disabling certain ports—highest priority number wins

  Load Balancing Techniques:
Round Robin: First come, first served
Application-Aware Balancing: Based on performance data
Weighted Average: Based on system capability or traffic need

    System Management Tools:
CDP / LLDP: Device discovery protocols
QoS (Quality of Service): Network traffic prioritization
Nmap: Network scanning
SNMP: Network monitoring
Wireshark: Packet analysis
OID: Object Identifier in SNMP
SIEM: Security Information and Event Management

Today was all about preparing for the worst and recovering like a pro. 
Understanding DRPs isn't just for the nerds in the server room—it’s business survival 101.
We don't just react—we recover with strategy.
