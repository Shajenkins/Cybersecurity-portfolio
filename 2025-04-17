Day In Review...
Today we began on subnet masks...
I must say it has been one of the hardest days for me so far, Although I was getting a little discouraged I have great classmates that were there to try an dhelp me understand. 
I learned that the subnet mask differenciates the network from the host number.
In this,I realize that I understand the classes and which part of the subnet mask to look at.
I can identify the class, if the IP is public or private and that if there is no subtnt mask to assume the default. 
I also know that with the IP + subnet mask you can identify the network, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and the broadcast.
I believe without Mr. Daryl's chart it would be ALOT more difficult for me to understand.
I am aware and am capable of identifying the long hand subnet and CIDR, for me I realize I am struggling finding the net and broadcast.
From my understanding, the goal is to identify where the host lies...
In order to do that you must split them into families, identify which are the net and broadcast then Identify where the host will lie in betwwen those four families.
But somewhere int the process I am finding myself confused..
I will be reaching out for a tutoring session in this subject.
We also touched basis oN IANA, ICANN and APIPA. 
IANA assigns authorized entities to public unique IP addresses and operate under ICANN, while APIPA will assign a temporary IP if the DHCP process does not respond in giving an IP,
