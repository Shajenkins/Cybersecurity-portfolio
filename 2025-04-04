Day In Review...
Today, we participated in various workshops focused on AI, from unlocking the potential of ChatGPT to fast-tracking AI for career advancement. 
My primary focus, however, was on ethics in AI.
We explored what fairness in AI truly means, who holds accountability when things go wrong, and the importance of transparency for everyday users. 
While I already knew AI wasn’t as safe as it’s often portrayed, today’s discussions highlighted a significant gap between certain communities and AI itself.
We delved into critical questions: Who owns the art and ideas created using AI? 
How does misinformation spread, and what role does tech gaslighting play? We also examined user accountability—how we willingly provide AI with our data and ideas, shaping its evolution.
Another major topic was accessibility. AI, as a business, inherently operates within a class-based structure—those who pay more often receive better tools and insights. 
However, there are alternative ways to make AI profitable without deepening this divide.
Today was eye-opening, sparking important conversations about AI’s impact on society. 
Let’s continue to challenge and reshape the way AI is built and accessed.
