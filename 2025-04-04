Day in Review ...
On this day, Today, we explored the fundamentals of Ethernet and compared different cable types.
We looked at the key differences between copper cables, such as Cat5e and Cat6, and fiber optic cables, focusing on speed, distance, and performance. 
Understanding these distinctions is crucial for selecting the right cabling for various network needs.
We also covered best practices for network cable installation, emphasizing the importance of neat and organized wiring. 
A well-structured cabling setup not only looks professional but also enhances network performance, reduces interference, and simplifies troubleshooting. 
Proper infrastructure is the backbone of a reliable network.
Finally, we dived into troubleshooting and maintenance techniques. 
We learned how to use tools like cable testers to diagnose and resolve common cabling issues. 
Recognizing symptoms of faulty connections and knowing how to address them ensures minimal downtime and a more efficient network.
The key takewaways for me from this lesson are 
Choosing the right cable type impacts network performance and longevity.
Well-organized cabling enhances efficiency and reduces future headaches.
Regular troubleshooting and maintenance keep networks running smoothly.
