Day In Review...

The CIA Triad

We started off by discussing the core pillars of security — the CIA Triad:
- Confidentiality: Preventing unauthorized disclosure of information.
- Integrity: Ensuring data is not modified or tampered with. Data should remain valid and unaltered.
- Availability: Making sure information is accessible when needed.

Non-Repudiation

- This ensures that actions or transactions can’t be denied. Receipts — it’s proof.

Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risk

- Threats: Potential cause of harm (e.g. hackers, natural disasters).
- Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses in a system that could be exploited.
- Risk: The intersection of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

Also discussed:
- Likelihood: Probability of a risk happening.
- Impact: The damage or consequence if it does.

Security Audits

A security audit is a systematic evaluation of:
- Compliance
- Risk
- Technology

Basically, you checking if your system's solid or not.

Regulatory Standards

- GDPR: EU’s regulation for data privacy and protection.
- PCI DSS: Security standards for handling credit card transactions.

 Cryptographic Concepts

- Used to hide/encode data using math.
- Hashing algorithms: MD5, SHA-128/256/512 — old and weak now, due to *collisions*.
- Encryption: Converts plaintext to ciphertext.
  - Symmetric: One private/shared key.
  - Asymmetric: Public key + private key (e.g., RSA).

State of Data

- At Rest: Stored data (e.g., databases, drives).
- In Transit: Moving through networks — protected by TLS, etc.
- In Use: Actively processed — must secure data in RAM, etc.

Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

- Flaws that haven’t been discovered yet by developers.
- No patch exists until it’s found 

Patch

- A software update that fixes bugs and vulnerabilities.

Honeypots vs Honeynets

- Honeypot: A decoy system designed to bait attackers.
- Honeynet: A network of honeypots. Casts a wider net for more insight.

Threat Actors

- Nation States
- Organized Crime
- Hacktivists
- Internal
- External

Enumeration

- Process of gathering intel:
  - Footprinting: Passive, non-intrusive.
  - Fingerprinting: Active, intrusive .

Denial of Service (DoS)

- Overloading a system to knock it offline.
- DDoS: Distributed DoS — coordinated attack using many systems.
- Botnet: Network of infected devices (aka zombies).

 Malware Types

- Ransomware: Locks systems, demands payment.
- Spoofing: Faking identity:
  - MAC spoofing
  - IP spoofing
  - ARP cache poisoning
- On-Path Attacks (aka Man-in-the-Middle):
  - Session hijacking
  - SSL stripping
  - DNS spoofing
  - WiFi spoofing
  - ARP spoofing

Network Attacks

- MAC Flooding
- VLAN Hopping
- Rogue Devices
- DHCP/DNS attacks
- SOHO exploitation 

Social Engineering

Manipulation techniques used to exploit human behavior:
- Impersonation
- Phishing
- Shoulder Surfing
- Dumpster Diving
- Tailgating (unauthorized access)
- Piggybacking (authorized access with consent)

Password Attacks

- Dictionary Attack: Tries words from a dictionary.
- Brute Force: Tries all combinations. Slow but effective if no protections.
